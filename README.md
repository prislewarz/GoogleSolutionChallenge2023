## What is stoPhone?

It is unimaginable to separate modern people from smartphones, and we spend so much time on smartphones.

In Korea, 24.2% of smartphone users are at risk of addiction (high risk group + potential risk group), and many people are already addicted to smartphones, and the number is increasing every year. This is not just a South Korean problem. It's a global problem.

The bigger problems are that smartphone addiction doesn't end with simple addiction, but abnormalities occur in various parts of the body, such as eyes, neck, wrists, shoulders. In addition, traffic accidents caused by using smartphones while walking, called smombie, are also a big problem.

In order to prevent the physical syndrome caused by smartphones and to solve the problems caused by smombie, we created an app called stoPhone.
